    <h1>Abstract</h1>

    <p>Ranges are immutable collections that can be enumerated but are
    represented algorithmically rather than by a per-element data
    structure.  This SRFI defines a large subset of the sequence operations
    defined on lists, vectors, and other collections.  If necessary,
    ranges can be converted to a list of its elements or a generator
    that will lazily produce each element in the range.</p>

    <h1>Issues</h1>

    None at present.

    <h1>Rationale</h1>

    <p>One of the most common things to do in programming is to execute
    a block of code a fixed number of times, with access to the index
    of the iteration.  Indeed, it is so common that there is generally
    a standard syntax for providing it, generally involving the keyword
    <code>for</code> (or if not, as in Fortran and Lisp, the word
    <code>do</code>).  It is also usual to provide a lower bound,
    generally defaulting to 0 or 1, as well as step size, allowing
    iterations through a sequence of odd numbers, or multiples of 10,
    or whatever.</p>

    <p>Languages with higher order functions, however, provide a second
    approach to such loops: construct a sequence of numbers and apply
    a function to each element of the sequence.  SRFI 1's <code>iota</code>
    and the standard <code>for-each</code> procedures make this easy:
    <code>(for-each (lambda (i) ...) (iota 0 10))</code>
    will execute the expressions represented as <code>...</code>
    with <code>i</code> bound to the numbers 0 through 9, as
    the generated list includes the lower bound and excludes the upper bound.</p>

    <p>This approach is less feasible as the number of numbers grows.
    To iterate a million times involves constructing a list of a million
    numbers to be iterated over and immediately discarded as garbage.
    This is not something you want to do in the inner loop of your code.
    The range objects of this SRFI represent such sequences using only
    a small fixed amount of storage.  Using
    <code>(range-for-each (lambda (i) ...) (numeric-range 0 1000000))</code>
    iterates a million times but with less space overhead than
    <code>iota</code>'s list of ten elements.</p>

    <p>In addition, there are other sequences besides integers from
    which a range may be drawn.  In particular, inexact numbers can
    also specify ranges: <code>(numeric-range 0.0 1.0 0.1)</code>
    specifies the sequence 0.0, 0.1, ... 0.9.  For another
    example, the basic Latin capital letters A-Z can be specified using
    a range constructed by <code>(range char-comparator #\A 26
    (lambda (c n) (integer->char (+ (char->integer c) n))))</code>.
    And to specify the geometric sequence 1, 1/2, 1/4, &hellip;, 1/512,
    <code>(range real-comparator 1/2 10 expt)</code> will do the job.
    These comparators can be found in SRFI 162.

    <h1>Specification</h1>

    <h2 id="constructors">Constructors</h2>
    <p><code>(range</code>&nbsp;<em>comparator lower-bound length indexer</em><code>)</code></p>
    <p>Returns a range whose lower bound is <i>lower-bound</i>
    and whose length (number of elements) is <i>length</i>.
    The <i>indexer</i> procedure returns the <i>n</i>th element
    (where 0 &#x2264; <i>n</i> &lt; <i>length</i>)
    of the range given <i>lower-bound</i> and <i>n</i>.
    The comparator object <i>comparator</i> is used to determine
    if a value is within the range or not.

    <p><code>(numeric-range</code>&nbsp;<em>start end</em> [<em>step</em>]<code>)</code></p>
    <p>Returns a numeric range, a special case of a range specified by an
    inclusive lower bound (default 0), an exclusive upper bound, and a
    step value (default 1), all of which can be exact or inexact real
    numbers. Its comparator is the natural comparator on real numbers,
    and its indexer is
    <code>(lambda (bound n) (+ bound (* n step)))</code>.
    It is an error if <i>upper-bound</i> - <i>lower-bound</i> is not a
    multiple of <i>step</i>.</p>

    <p>Note that an effect of this definition is that the elements of
    a range over inexact numbers are enumerated by multiplying the index
    by the step value rather than by adding the step value to itself
    repeatedly.  This reduces the likelihood of roundoff errors.</p>


    <h2 id="predicates">Predicates</h2>

    <p><code>(range?</code>&nbsp;<em>obj</em><code>)</code></p>
    <p>Returns <code>#t</code> if <em>obj</em> is a range and <code>#f</code>

    <p>Returns true if value is an element of <em>range</em>.</p>

    <p><code>(range-includes?</code>&nbsp;<em>range value</em><code>)</code></p>
    <p>Returns true if value is greater than or equal to the range start and less
    than or equal to the range end, whether or not it is an element of the
    range.</p>

    <p><code>(range-empty?</code>&nbsp;<em>range</em><code>)</code></p>
    <p>Returns true if <em>range</em> is empty.</p>

    <em>range</em>.</p>

    <p><code>(range-start</code>&nbsp;<em>range</em><code>)</code></p>
    <p>Shorthand for <code>(range-ref</code>&nbsp;<em>range</em>
    <code>0)</code>.</p>

    <p><code>(range-end</code>&nbsp;<em>range</em><code>)</code></p>
    <p>Shorthand for <code>(range-ref</code>&nbsp;<em>range</em> <code>(-

    <h1>Implementation</h1>

    <p>The sample implementation is in the repository of this SRFI.
    An R7RS library file and a separate file containing the actual
    implementation are provided, along with a test file that
    works with SRFI 78, but is self-contained if SRFI 78 does not exist.
    The implementation needs SRFI 1 and SRFI 128, and can take
    advantage of SRFI 145 (<code>assume</code>) if it is present.</p>
