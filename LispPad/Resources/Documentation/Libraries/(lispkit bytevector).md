# LispKit Bytevector

_Bytevectors_ represent blocks of binary data. They are fixed-length sequences of bytes, where a _byte_ is a fixnum in the range from 0 to 255 inclusive. A bytevector is typically more space-efficient than a vector containing the same values.

The _length_ of a bytevector is the number of elements that it contains. The length is a non-negative integer that is fixed when the bytevector is created. The _valid indexes_ of a bytevector are the exact non-negative integers less than the length of the bytevector, starting at index zero as with vectors.

Bytevectors are written using the notation `#u8(byte ...)`. For example, a bytevector of length 3 containing the byte 0 in element 0, the byte 10 in element 1, and the byte 5 in element 2 can be written as follows: `#u8(0 10 5)`. Bytevector constants are self-evaluating, so they do not need to be quoted.

## Basic

**(bytevector? _obj_)** <span style="float:right;text-align:rigth;">[procedure]</span>   

Returns `#t` if _obj_ is a bytevector; otherwise, `#f` is returned.

**(bytevector _byte ..._)** <span style="float:right;text-align:rigth;">[procedure]</span>   

Returns a newly allocated bytevector containing its arguments as bytes in the given order.

```scheme
(bytevector 1 3 5 1 3 5)  ⇒  #u8(1 3 5 1 3 5)
(bytevector)              ⇒  #u8()
```

**(make-bytevector _k_)** <span style="float:right;text-align:rigth;">[procedure]</span>   
**(make-bytevector _k byte_)**   

The `make-bytevector` procedure returns a newly allocated bytevector of length _k_. If _byte_ is given, then all elements of the bytevector are initialized to _byte_, otherwise the contents of each element are unspecified.

```scheme
(make-bytevector 3 12)  ⇒  #u8(12 12 12)
```

**(bytevector-length _bytevector_)** <span style="float:right;text-align:rigth;">[procedure]</span>   

Returns the length of bytevector in bytes as an exact integer.

**(bytevector-u8-ref _bytevector k_)** <span style="float:right;text-align:rigth;">[procedure]</span>   

Returns the _k_-th byte of _bytevector_. It is an error if _k_ is not a valid index of bytevector. 

```scheme
(bytevector-u8-ref #u8(1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21) 5)  ⇒  8
```

**(bytevector-u8-set! _bytevector k byte_)** <span style="float:right;text-align:rigth;">[procedure]</span>   

Stores _byte_ as the _k_-th byte of bytevector. It is an error if _k_ is not a valid index of bytevector.

```scheme
(let ((bv (bytevector 1 2 3 4)))
  (bytevector-u8-set! bv 1 3)
  bv)
⇒  #u8(1 3 3 4)
```

**(bytevector-copy _bytevector_)** <span style="float:right;text-align:rigth;">[procedure]</span>   
**(bytevector-copy _bytevector start_)**   
**(bytevector-copy _bytevector start end_)**   

Returns a newly allocated bytevector containing the bytes in _bytevector_ between _start_ and _end_. If _end_ is not provided, it is assumed to be the length of _bytevector_. If _start_ is not provided, it is assumed to be 0.

```scheme
(define a #u8(1 2 3 4 5))
(bytevector-copy a 2 4))   ⇒  #u8(3 4)
```

**(bytevector-copy! _to at from_)** <span style="float:right;text-align:rigth;">[procedure]</span>   
**(bytevector-copy! _to at from start_)**   
**(bytevector-copy! _to at from start end_)**   

Copies the bytes of bytevector _from_ between _start_ and _end_ to bytevector _to_, starting at _at_. The order in which bytes are copied is unspecified, except that if the source and destination overlap, copying takes place as if the source is first copied into a temporary bytevector and then into the destination. This can be achieved without allocating storage by making sure to copy in the correct direction in such circumstances.

It is an error if _at_ is less than zero or greater than the length of _to_. It is also an error if `(- (bytevector-length to) at)` is less than `(- end start)`.

```scheme
(define a (bytevector 1 2 3 4 5))
(define b (bytevector 10 20 30 40 50))
(bytevector-copy! b 1 a 0 2)
b  ⇒  #u8(10 1 2 40 50)
```

**(bytevector-append _bytevector ..._)** <span style="float:right;text-align:rigth;">[procedure]</span>   

Returns a newly allocated bytevector whose elements are
the concatenation of the elements in the given bytevectors.

```scheme
(bytevector-append #u8(0 1 2) #u8(3 4 5))
  ⇒  #u8(0 1 2 3 4 5)
```

## Input/Output

**(read-binary-file _path_)** <span style="float:right;text-align:rigth;">[procedure]</span>   

Reads the file at _path_ and stores its content in a new bytevector which gets returned by `read-binary-file`.

**(write-binary-file _path bytevector_)** <span style="float:right;text-align:rigth;">[procedure]</span>   
**(write-binary-file _path bytevector start_)**

## Advanced

**(utf8-\>string _bytevector_)** <span style="float:right;text-align:rigth;">[procedure]</span>   
**(utf8-\>string _bytevector start_)**   
**(utf8-\>string _bytevector start end_)**

**(string-\>utf8 _string start_)**   
**(string-\>utf8 _string start end_)**   

These procedures translate between strings and bytevectors that encode those strings using the UTF-8 encoding. The `utf8->string` procedure decodes the bytes of a _bytevector_ between _start_ and _end_ and returns the corresponding string. The `string->utf8` procedure encodes the characters of a _string_ between _start_ and _end_ and returns the corresponding bytevector.

It is an error for _bytevector_ to contain invalid UTF-8 byte sequences.

```scheme
(utf8->string #u8(#x41))  ⇒  "A"
(string->utf8 "λ")        ⇒  #u8(#xCE #xBB)
