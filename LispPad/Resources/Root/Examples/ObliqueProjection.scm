;;; Oblique projection of points, lines and planes
;;; 
;;; This program visualizes points, lines and planes in a 3-dimensional cartesian coordinate
;;; system using an oblique projection as described in http://zenger.org/papers/fa.pdf (in
;;; German). All projection and transformation logic is contained in the LispKit example
;;; code `VisualizePointSets.scm`. The code in this program simply displays one or two
;;; visualizations in the LispPad Go console.
;;; 
;;; Example usage:
;;;   (projection-drawing point-set-1)
;;;   (projection-drawing point-set-2)
;;;   (dual-projection-drawing point-set-1 point-set-2)
