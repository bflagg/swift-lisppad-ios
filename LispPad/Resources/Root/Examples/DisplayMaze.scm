;;; Display mazes in a graphics window
;;;
;;; This is an extension of the `LispKit` sample code "Examples/Maze.scm". It loads the
;;; `LispKit` sample code and implements a simple procedure for rendering mazes in a
;;; drawing.
;;;
;;; Usage:
;;;   (maze-drawing (make-maze/randomized-dfs 25 25) 15 15)
;;;   (maze-drawing (make-maze/bintree 25 25) 15 15)
